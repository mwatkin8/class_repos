    "Photographers use the Japanese word “bokeh” to describe the blurring of the out-of-focus parts of an image. Its aesthetic quality can greatly enhance a photograph, and photographers artfully use focus to draw attention to subjects of interest. “Good bokeh” contributes visual interest to a photograph and places its subjects in context.\n",

    "    * What are the best perceptual approaches to honestly and accurately represent the data to domain experts and SMEs so they can apply their intuition to the data?\n",
    "        * Are there automated approaches to accurately reduce large datasets so that outliers and anomalies are still visible, while we meaningfully represent baselines and backgrounds? How can we do this without “washing away” all the interesting bits during a naive downsampling?\n",
    "        * If we treat the pixels and topology of pixels on a screen as a bottleneck in the I/O channel between hard drives and an analyst’s visual cortex, what are the best compression techniques at all levels of the data transformation pipeline?\n",
    "* How can scientists and data analysts be empowered to use visualization fluidly, not merely as an output facility or one stage of a pipeline, but as an entire mode of engagement with data and models?\n",
    "    * Are language-based approaches for expressing mathematical modeling and data transformations the best way to compose novel interactive graphics?\n",
