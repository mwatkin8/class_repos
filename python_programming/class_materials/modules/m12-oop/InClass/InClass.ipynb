    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming is one of the most common [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). Most of what we have done so far in this course has been writing procedural code that at times takes advantage of the object oriented nature of Python. As I look at the computational environment currently, object oriented programming might be most fruitfully contrasted with functional programming which has become very important for concurrent programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key concepts that differentiates functional and object oriented (and procedural) programming is known as [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science): some observable in the program is changed by a function or expression. This is problematic for parallel programming as one thread may depend on a variable that has been changed by another thread. In object oriented programming, the class methods can modify/change the object instances. In functional programming, we (at least try) do not change variable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newer languages like [Julia](http://julialang.org/) attempt to incorporate object oriented ideas into a functional programming paradigm. In Julia we can define classes, but classes do not have methods that modify them. Rather Julia uses functions that take objects as arguments and return new objects as results. The same programming style can be achieved with Python (see, for example, [Functional Python Programming](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781784396992/cover/cover_html?uicode=uutah)), where one might make a class inherited from a tuple (or named tuple) and then define methods for visualizing, comparing values, etc. but not modifying them."
