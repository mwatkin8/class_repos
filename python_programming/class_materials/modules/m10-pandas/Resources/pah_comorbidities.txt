                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74-year-old man with CAD, PVD, with three months of nausea,
     vomiting, and diarrhea with diffuse abdominal pain and 30-pound weight loss
     over the last month.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     without IV contrast secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images were also displayed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Non-specific interstitial opacity seen
     at the right base, with evidence of bronchiectasis and small blebs.  These
     likely represent post-inflammatory changes.  No focal consolidations or
     pleural effusions are seen at the visualized lung bases.
     
     Tiny calcifications are seen within the liver, likely representing sequelae of
     prior granulomatous infection.  Assessment of the abdomen is limited by the
     lack of IV contrast; however, no focal lesions identified within the liver.
     Allowing for limitations of a non-contrast study, the pancreas, spleen, and
     adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  Small rounded hypodensities are seen
     within the right kidney, possibly representing simple cysts, but not fully
     characterized on this non-contrast study.  Tiny calcific density is seen
     within the right kidney, possibly representing small stone versus vascular
     calcification.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy and left
     nephrectomy.  Visualized portions of the bowel appear unremarkable. No
     evidence of free fluid within the abdomen.  Diffuse vascular calcifications
     are noted throughout the aorta and its branches.
     
     A small hiatal hernia is noted.  Also seen is evidence of cardiomegaly.

     HISTORY:  74-year-old man with history of CHF, COPD, now with cough; assess
     for pneumonia versus CHF.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labeled ""Erect, 16:35 h"" with no comparisons
     on record.  There is streaky linear opacity at the medial aspect of the right
     more than left lung base, likely representing chronic scarring. The lungs are
     otherwise well-inflated and clear, without focal consolidation. A left-sided
     dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker has intact lead tips projected over the RA and
     RV apex (on this single view).  The heart is within normal limits in size.
     There is slight relative prominence and blurring of the upper zone pulmonary
     vessels consistent with early pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial
     edema.  No overt edema or pleural effusion is identified. There are
     atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta.  Scattered surgical
     clips are barely discernable in the left paraspinal region, perhaps related to
     prior nephrectomy, with cholecystectomy clips in the right upper abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Evidence of early pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
     2.  Probable scarring at the medial aspect of the right lung base, with no
     definite consolidation.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
     
     When compared to prior radiograph, there appears to be marked improvement and
     near resolution of bilateral pulmonary edema along with near
     complete resolution of retrocardiac opacity likely representing areas of left
     lower lobe atelectasis/collapse.  Small areas of basilar atelectasis are noted
     bilaterally, and there appears to have been slight worsening of left-sided
     pleural effusion, with stable appearance of small right-sided pleural
     effusion.  Areas of scarring within the right medial lung base are unchanged.
     Left-sided pacemaker/ICD device is unchanged in position.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Near complete resolution of pulmonary edema along with retrocardiac
     opacity, likely representing areas of left lower lobe atelectasis.

     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        10.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest ([**3289-2-3**]);
        27.5 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**3289-2-3**]);
     HISTORY: 74 year old man with history of non-ST elevation MI and pacemaker  
     placement presenting with chest pain. 
      
     SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
     mg/kg/min.    
       
     METHOD: 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi.  Tracer was
     injected approximately one hour prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     Two minutes after the cessation of infusion of dipyridamole, approximately three
     times the resting dose of Tc99m sestamibi was administered IV.  Stress images
     were obtained approximately one hour following tracer injection. 
     Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.  
       
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Left ventricular cavity size is moderately dilated at stress and rest.  
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a mild fixed defect of the inferior and
     inferolateral walls.   
       
     Gated images reveal global hypokinesis. 
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 35%.    
       
     No prior studies.  
       
     IMPRESSION:  There is a mild fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and
     inferolateral walls.  The left ventricle is moderately dilated at stress and
     rest and there is global hypokinesis with a calculated LVEF of 35%

     INDICATION:  77-year-old man with right hip pain and TTP, status post fall,
     rule out fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the pelvis and two views of the right hip.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a right nondisplaced intertrochanteric hip fracture. There
     is an additional obliquely angled fracture through the greater trochanter.  In
     addition, there is an avulsion fracture of the lesser trochanter with medial
     displacement of the fracture fragment.  No other fractures are seen in the
     pelvis.  Bony mineralization appears within normal limits.
     
     Findings have been communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2566**] at the time of dictation.

     white count.
     
     Comparison is made to [**3063-3-27**].
     
     AP SEMI-UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There are intact midline sternotomy
     wires.  There are minimal atelectatic changes at both lung bases.  There also
     is a lucid crescent in the proximity of the right hemidiaphragm.  In order to
     exclude that this is free intraabdominal air, a left lateral decubitus film is
     recommended.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
     are unremarkable.  No evidence for consolidations.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence for pneumonia.
     
     2.  Minimal bibasilar atelectatic changes.
     
     3.  Lucid crescent in proximity of the right diaphragm.  In order to exclude
     free intraabdominal air, a left lateral decubitus film centered on the right
     diaphragm is recommended.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2585**] was informed of the possibility of free intraabdominal air via
     telephone at the time of dication.

     INDICATION:  77-year-old man status post CABG.  Question free air on recent
     chest x-ray.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Earlier chest x-ray of the same day.
     
     CHEST, LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS: There has been no significant change in the
     appearance of the chest, allowing for differences in technique.
     
     A left- side downward decubitus view was performed, but this view is not
     centered on the hemidiaphragm.  If free air were present adjacent to the
     liver, it would not be seen on this view. If clinically indicated, a true
     upright abdominal view or a left side down decubitus view, which includes
     visualization in the right upper quadrant could be performed to rule out a
     subtle manifestation of free air.
     
     IMPRESSION: No significant change, but non-diagnostic for free air. The
     findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2587**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2588**] PA.

     INDICATION:  Status post fall.  No focal tenderness.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired images of the cervical spine were obtained with
     coronal and sagittal reformatted images.
     
     CT C-SPINE:  The alignment is normal.  There are multilevel degenerative
     changes.  No fracture is identified.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue
     swelling.  Incidental note made of tonsillar calcifications bilaterally, some
     quite superficial in locale, and likely post-inflammatory in origin . Imaged
     portions of the lung apices are clear. There are aortic calcifications and
     also involving the origin of the left subclavian artery,  common carotid
     bifurcations and distal left vertebral artery, likely atherosclerotic in
     origin.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
     
     ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a moderate anterior wedge compression
     fracture of the T3 vertebral body. The presence of adjacent osteophytes raises
     the possibility that the fracture is chronic, but this observation requires
     clinical correlation.
     
     There is a 7mm rounded lymph node in the right submental region. Etiology for
     this finding is uncertain, and may require further workup as well.

     INDICATION:  Followup.  Rule out pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated [**3063-9-10**].
     
     SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Patient is rotated to the left.  Multiple
     median sternotomy wires appear intact.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
     are stable, with a left ventricular configuration of the heart again noted.
     There is interval improvement in the previously demonstrated CHF/pulmonary
     edema.  There is a vertically oriented ovoid lucency that projects at the left
     lung apex,  probably due to the patient's left rotation.  There may be minimal
     right basilar atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary vascular prominence.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval resolution in pulmonary edema

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the head obtained without IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. The
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears preserved.  There is no
     hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.  The basal cisterns
     appear patent.  No fractures are identified.  There is moderate opacification
     of the ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.

     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [**3063-12-18**].
     
     HISTORY:  78 year-old man with history of multiple falls, now status post fall
     with ?LOC, on anticoagulation; evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
     skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain and bone window on the
     workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Study is compared with the recent NECT, dated [**3063-12-16**]; there is no
     significant overall change.  There is swelling of the left frontovertex scalp
     soft tissues with skin staples at site of laceration, not present previously.
     No underlying skull fracture is seen.  There is no intra- or extra-axial
     hemorrhage and the midline structures are in the midline.  There is mild,
     proportionate prominence of the cortical sulci and fissures and ventricles and
     cisterns, representing mild atrophy.  There are irregular low-attenuation foci
     in bilateral lentiform nuclei, left more than right, with some volume loss and
     ex vacuo dilatation of the ipsilateral sylvian fissure, representing confluent
     chronic lacunar infarcts.  There is no specific evidence of acute vascular
     territorial infarction.  There is extensive opacification of bilateral ethmoid
     air cells, right more than left.  The mastoid air cells and middle ear
     cavities are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No definite acute intracranial abnormality.
     
     2.  Mild atrophy and left more than right basal ganglia chronic lacunes, with
     some volume loss.
     
     3.  Chronic-appearing ethmoid inflammatory disease.
