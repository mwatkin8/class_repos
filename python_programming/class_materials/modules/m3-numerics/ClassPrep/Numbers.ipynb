    ">Numbers arose from the formalization of two different human-cognitive conceptions: counting and measurement. Based on fossil records, anthropologists believe that both concepts existed and were used many thousands of years before numbers were introduced. As early as 35,000 years ago, humans put notches into bones (and probably wooden sticks as well, but none have survived and been found) to record things— possibly the cycles of the moon or the seasons— and it seems probable they used sticks or lengths of vine to measure lengths. Numbers themselves, however— abstractions that stand for the number of notches on a bone or the length of a measuring device— appear to have first appeared much later, around 10,000 years ago in the case of counting collections. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">These activities resulted in two different kinds of number: the **discrete counting numbers** and the **continuous [measuring] real numbers**. The connection between these two kinds of numbers was not finally put onto a firm footing until the nineteenth century, with the construction of the modern real number system.
