 Reason: TIA
 
 UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
 72 year old man with TIA 
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
 Eval for carotid stenosis 
 CAROTID STUDY
 
 HISTORY: TIA.
 
 FINDINGS: No prior studies for comparison. There is complete 
 occlusion of the left ICA and associated internalization of the 
 external carotid artery on the left. There is also absent flow 
 involving the left vertebral artery. There is a significant 
 focal hypoechoic plaque involving the right ICA. Similar plaque 
 involving the right ECA. The peak systolic velocities on the 
 right are 264, 56, and 15 cm per second for the ICA, CCA, and 
 ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 5.3. There is 
 antegrade flow involving the right vertebral artery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Occluded left-sided ICA and left-sided vertebral artery.
 
 2. 70-79% right ICA stenosis.
 
 3. Near occlusion of the right external carotid artery.

EXAM: MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left internal carotid artery 
 occlusion and right ICA stenosis, for further evaluation to 
 exclude stroke and also to evaluate the cerebral blood vessels.
 
 
 
 MRA OF THE NECK:
 
 The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the right 
 vertebral artery. The right internal carotid demonstrates 
 high-grade approximately 70% stenosis at the bifurcation. The 
 evaluation of the right carotid stenosis on the post- gadolinium 
 MRA is limited secondary to venous contamination.
 
 The left internal carotid is occluded at the bifurcation. No 
 flow is visualized in the distal cervical left internal carotid 
 artery. No flow is seen in the left petrous carotid artery.
 
 The evaluation of the left vertebral artery on source images 
 demonstrate flow signal in a markedly narrowed left vertebral 
 artery in the proximal portion. Subtle flow signal is also seen 
 in the left V3 segment of the vertebral artery. This finding is 
 indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left 
 vertebral artery. The visualized great vessels of the thoracic 
 inlet demonstrate no evidence of high-grade stenosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at 
 the bifurcation. 2. High-grade stenosis of the right internal 
 carotid bifurcation. Normal right vertebral artery. 3. Diffuse 
 atherosclerotic disease involving left vertebral artery with 
 partial visualization in the proximal and distal portions.
 
 MRA OF THE HEAD:
 
 The head MRA demonstrates absence of flow signal in the distal 
 left internal carotid artery. The supraclinoid internal carotid 
 artery is minimally visualized with flow visualized from the 
 left PCA to the left middle cerebral artery. On the right side 
 normal flow signal is seen in the supraclinoid internal carotid, 
 right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior 
 communicating artery is also visualized on the right side.
 
 In the posterior circulation, diffuse narrowing of the basilar 
 artery is visualized with absence of flow signal in the distal 
 basilar artery indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease 
 with high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the distal basilar 
 artery. Both distal vertebral arteries demonstrate narrowed flow 
 signal caliber.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid with collateral flow 
 to the left MCA through the left posterior communicating artery. 
 Normal flow signal in the right supraclinoid internal carotid, 
 right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. Diffuse 
 atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery with probable 
 occlusion or high-grade stenosis in the distal basilar artery.

      DUPLEX CAROTID ULTRASOUND
      
      INDICATION:  Carotid bruit.  Slow to wake status post CABG.  Evaluate for
      stenosis.
      
      FINDINGS:  There was a modest amount of atherosclerotic plaque at the origins
      of the ICAs and ECAs bilaterally.
      
      On the right, peak systolic velocities measured 99, 65, and 82 cm/sec
      respectively in the right ICA, CCA, and ECA.  The right ICA/ECA ratio measured
      1.52.
      
      On the left, the peak systolic velocities measured 93, 70, and 88 cm/sec
      respectively in the left ICA, CCA, and ECA.  Left ICA/CCA ratio was 1.32.
      
      The peak systolic velocity in the left vertebral artery was 81 cm/sec with
      normal arterial waveforms.  However, the peak velocity in the right vertebral
      artery was 17, and to and fro flow was noted with tardus parvus.  There is
      also decreased triphasic flow in the right brachial artery.  These are
      suggestive of a right subclavian steal.
      
      IMPRESSION:  Less than 40% stenosis in both carotids.
      
      Right subclavian steal.

      LEFT SIDE:  There is a moderate plaque at the origin in proximal internal
      carotid artery.  The peak systolic velocity in the common carotid artery 75

      FINDINGS:  The left internal carotid artery is occluded proximally by a large
      calcified plaque.  The left common carotid and external carotid arteries are
      patent.  The left vertebral artery was not visualized.
      
      On the right, moderate atherosclerotic plaque is seen.  Peak velocities
      measured 124/52, 78, 96, and 67 cm/sec respectively in the right ICA, CCA,
      ECA, and vertebral arteries.  The right ICA/CCA ratio measures 1.5.
