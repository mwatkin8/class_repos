    ">With an absurd oversimplification, the \"invention\" of the calculus is sometimes ascribed to two men, Newton and Leibniz. In reality, the calculus is the product of a long evolution that was neither initiated nor terminated by Newton and Leibniz, but in which both played a decisive part. Scattered over seventeenth century Europe, for the post part outside the schools, was a group of spirited scientists who strove to continue the mathematical work of Galileo and Kepler. By correspondence and travel the men maintained close contact. Two central problems held their attention. First, *the problem of tangents:* to determine the tangent lines to a given curve, the fundamental problem of the differential calculus. Second, *the problem of quadrature:* to determine the area with a given curve, the fundamental problem of the integral calculus. Newton's and Leibniz' great merit is to have clearly recognized the intimate *connection between these two problems.* In their hands the new unified methods became powerful instruments of science. Much of the success was due to the marvelous symbolic notation invented by Leibniz. (*What is Mathematics,* p. 398)\n",
