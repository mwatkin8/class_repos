# Coursework

## Homework Guidelines

Learning programming and mathematics are “doing intensive” enterprises: you learn by doing them. We will have weekly homework assignments. These will primarily be programming problems but will also include some written responses and some basic mathematics exercises. Homework solutions will typically be submitted as Jupyter notebooks. Written responses will be entered in Markdown cells and programming responses will be entered in code cells.

Grading will be based on the following rubric:

* ✓ +: (100%) Student went beyond expectations. Program (if relevant) runs as expected. Code is clean and well commented. Written explanations are accurate and thorough.
* ✓ : (90%) Program (if relevant) run as expected. Written explanations are accurate.
* ✓ -: (70%) Program (if relevant) is completed but does not run as expected. Written explanations are partially correct
* F: (0%) Submitted solutions are either absent or do not demonstrate a realistic effort to address the problem.

Homework will be submitted using a private git repository (e.g. on GitHub or Bitbucket) that each student creates and to which the instructor and TA are added as collaborators. By default GitHub repositories are public. However, if you have an education e-mail, you can request an upgrade of your GitHub account to get private repositories. You can also create a free, private git repository at [https://gitlab.chpc.utah.edu](https://gitlab.chpc.utah.edu).

Homework assignments can be (indeed are encouraged to be) worked on in groups, but each student will submit their own homework. Homework solutions will be reviewed in class and each student must be prepared to defend/explain their homework solutions to the rest of the class during the beginning of the class period (part of the class participation grade).

Homework assignments will be assigned with each module throughout the week and will typically be due one week after they are assigned (an explicit due date and time will be given with each assignment). Late homework assignments will be scored at 80% of earned credit. Homework assignments can be regraded to regain up to half the marked-down score in conjunction with personal meetings with a TA or the instructor.

## Quiz Guidelines

There will be an online quiz for each module that must be completed prior to the start of the relevant class. These will be short (approximately 10 minute), multiple choice and true/false type questions.

## Term Project Guidelines

An introductory course cannot cover all the programming topics that may be of interest to a student, and because we want the course to be as applicable as possible to the student’s graduate research or application experience, the course project is a way for students to customize their learning experience.

The course project represents a significant programming project addressing a problem of interest (use case) to the student(s), hopefully related to their field of research or application. The work involved in this project should represent an effort equivalent to three to four homework assignments.

The project should have at least the following components:

1. An open source license.
1. A class that you have defined and an derived class that inherits from this parent class. The classes can be simple, but you should have at least a useful ``__str__`` method.
1. Data permanence using a database (e.g. SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB) or some form of data serialization (e.g. JSON).
1. A user interface. This could be a web application (such as Flask or Django); an application built with pyQT4 or wxWindows; an Jupyter notebook with widgets; or a command line interface.
1. Some sort of visualization. This can be a static matplotlib-generated figure or an interactive plot with Bokeh or mpld3.
1. A detailed README.md that describes the problem your project is addressing including any domain knowledge that will help someone (me) outside of your expertise appreciate the intent of the project, provides a description of the dependencies (any install instructions), instructions on how to use the project with example use cases.
1. The project should be well written Python program that follows Google’s Python style guide.

Create a separate git (e.g. Bitbucket or GitHub) repository for the project.

## In-Class Activities

* Some or all of these. (It will be mixed up during the semester)

### Review previous HW solutions
* On a random basis a student will be selected to present (briefly) their solution to a particular homework problem that has been turned in.
    * Encourage completion and understanding (versus copying) of homework
    * Opportunity to get/give feedback on coding.

### Discuss Any questions that arose from reviewing (reading/viewing) new materials.

* We should have two modules "released" each week between class (e.g. Friday and Tuesday). Review quizzes for each module (completed during the week). I'll give a brief highlight in class. Class discussion.
    * Science with Songs
    * Greek Myths of the Day
### In-class programming exercises.
* Small groups
* Class-wide (most popular)
    * Students take turns at the podium writing part of a program.

### Term project updates
* Students will take turns describing their term projects and what progress they are making.
    * Opportunity for feedback, suggestions, partnerships
    * Ensure that you are working on that which is valuable for you.
