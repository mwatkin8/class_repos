**Faculty Responsibilities**: (from University of Utah Policies and
Procedures Manual)

> 1.     Faculty members are expected to meet their regularly scheduled
> classes. Failure to meet scheduled classes without prior notice to
> students is excusable only for reasons beyond the control of faculty
> members. Alteration of schedules, cancellation or rescheduling of
> classes may be done only for valid reasons and after adequate notice
> to students.
>
> 2.     Faculty members shall engage in reasonable and substantial
> preparation for the teaching of courses assigned to them, consistent
> with their scope and nature and appropriate to the educational
> objectives sought to be achieved.
>
> 3.     Faculty members must maintain regular office hours during which
> they are available for consultation with students or otherwise assure
> their accessibility to students.
>
> 4.    Faculty members must, at the beginning of a course, give
> reasonable notice to students of the general content of the course,
> what will be required of the students, and the criteria upon which
> their performance will be evaluated. Evaluations must be performed
> promptly, conscientiously, without prejudice or favoritism, and
> consistently with the criteria stated at the beginning of the course.
> The criteria for evaluating student performance must relate to the
> legitimate academic purposes of the course. Grade appeals submitted by
> students are not considered charges of misconduct under this code.
> \[For the appeals procedure, see the student code, [PPM
> 8-10.2](http://www.admin.utah.edu/ppmanual/8/8-10-2.html), Article
> III, section 3.04.\]
>
> 5.     Faculty members must not misuse the classroom by preempting
> substantial portions of class time for the presentation of their own
> views on topics unrelated to the subject matter of the course. Where
> faculty members find it pedagogically useful to advocate a position on
> controversial matters, they must exercise care to assure that
> opportunities exist for students to consider other views. Faculty
> members must not reward agreement or penalize disagreement with their
> views on controversial topics.
>
> 6.    Faculty members must not use their position, authority, or
> relationship with students to obtain uncompensated labor for their own
> personal or pecuniary gain. They may not ask students to perform
> services unrelated to legitimate academic requirements of a course
> unless the student is adequately compensated for such services.
> Faculty members must not solicit gifts or favors from students. They
> must not accept gifts or favors where they have reason to believe that
> such gift or favor is motivated by a desire to secure some academic
> advantage.
>
> 7.     Faculty members must not plagiarize the work of a student.
> Where a faculty member and a student work together, appropriate credit
> must be given to the student. Faculty members may not limit or curtail
> the right of a student to publish or otherwise communicate the result
> of the student's own scholarly activities.

-   Faculty members must not reveal matters related in explicit
    confidence by a student, except as required by law or university
    policy. Personal matters relating to a student must not be revealed
    by faculty members except to persons entitled to such information by

    persons making legitimate inquiry provided such disclosure is in
    accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
    ("FERPA").
