    "[Gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) is an optimization algorithm used to find the local minimum of a function. It is commonly used in many different machine learning algorithms. In this blog post, I will explain the principles behind gradient descent using Python, starting with a simple example of how gradient descent can be used to find the local minimum of a quadratic equation, and then progressing to applying gradient descent to linear regression. By the end of the post, you should be able to code your own version of gradient descent and understand the concept behind it."

    "We can also find the local minimum with gradient descent - it's an iterative function using the steepest descent. To find the local minimum, you start at a random point, and move into the direction of steepest descent relative to the gradient, i.e. into the direction that goes down (hence, *descent*). In this example, let's suppose we start at $x = 15$. The gradient at this point is $2 \\times 15 - 6 = 24$. Because we're using gradient *descent*, we need to subtract the gradient from our $x$-coordinate. However, notice that $16 - 25$ gives us $-9$, clearly overshooting over target of $-3$. To fix this, we multiply the gradient by a *step size*. This step size (often called alpha) has to be chosen carefully, as a value too small will result in a long computation time, while a value too large will not give you the right result (by overshooting) or even fail to converge. In this example, we'll set the step size to 0.01, which means we'll subtract $24 \\times 0.01$ from 15, which is $14.76$. This is now our new temporary local minimum: We continue this method until we either don't see a change after we subtracted the gradient * step size, or until we've completed a pre-set number of iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I've coded this algorithm in Python. The algorithm stops when the values between the new and the temporary minimum do not differ by more than 0.001 - if we need more precision, we can decrease this value. According to gradient descent, the local minimum occurs at $3.05$, which is not too far off from the true local minimum."

    "And that's it: We used gradient descent successfully to find regression parameters that fit our test data! I hope these examples and the code were helpful in explaining both the conceptual background behind gradient descent, and how it can be implemented. As a introductory tutorial, there is a lot I left out, and if you're interested, I recommend checking out Andrew Ng's machine learning [course on Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/9), as well as his [lecture notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf). Additionally, here is a list of blog posts covering gradient descent in Python:\n",

    "As you have  probably noticed, there were simpler ways to find the solution to our two problems analytically, but it served as a good showcase to show the effectiveness of gradient descent compared to the analytic solutions. Furthermore, gradient descent is commonly used in neural networks, where you might have to implement it yourself -  check out Andrej Karpathy's [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks\n",

    "As a last note, I wanted to mention that both examples here only have one minimum, and are [convex functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function). This means that no matter where we start (initial values of theta), we arrive at the minimum. This is not always the case. The plot below shows the convexity of the linear regression example, with the red point denoting the minimum. No matter where on the plane we start, gradient descent works as a compass pointing to the minimum."
