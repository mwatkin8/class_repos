    "# Basic Visualization Tools in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing data in an important part of data exploration. In fact, there is a whole field of \"visual analytics\" which parallels statistical and mathematical explorations of data. We have been using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), which is the most common graphing package in Python. However, there are a number of other tools that you might want to/should become familiar with. For this module, we will just provide a few illustrations of the most common tools and point you towards some others.\n",
