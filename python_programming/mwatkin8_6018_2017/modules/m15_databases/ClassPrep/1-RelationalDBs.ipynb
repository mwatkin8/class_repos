    "* What is a Relational Database?\n",
    ">The relational model's central idea is to describe a database as a collection of predicates over a finite set of predicate variables, describing constraints on the possible values and combinations of values. The content of the database at any given time is a finite (logical) model of the database, i.e. a set of relations, one per predicate variable, such that all predicates are satisfied. A request for information from the database (a database query) is also a predicate. ([Wikipedia, \"Relational Model\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model))\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The fundamental assumption of the relational model is that all data is represented as mathematical n-ary relations, an n-ary relation being a subset of the Cartesian product of n domains. In the mathematical model, reasoning about such data is done in two-valued predicate logic, meaning there are two possible evaluations for each proposition: either true or false (and in particular no third value such as unknown, or not applicable, either of which are often associated with the concept of NULL). Data are operated upon by means of a relational calculus or relational algebra, these being equivalent in expressive power. ([Wikipedia, \"Relational Model\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model))\n",

    "## Why Are Relational Databases Popular?\n",

    "* **Tables (CREATE TABLE):**\n",
    ">Before you can do anything, you have to understand tables. If you don't have a table, you have nothing to work on. The table is the standard unit of information in a relational database. Everything revolves around tables. Tables are composed of rows and columns. And while that sounds simple, the sad truth is that tables are not simple. (*The Definitive Guide to SQLite*)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modifying Tables (INSERT, ALTER, DELETE)**\n",
    "* **Querying Tables (SELECT):**\n",
    ">If the SELECT command is the most complex command in SQL, then the WHERE  clause is the most complex clause in SELECT. (*The Definitive Guide to SQLite*)\n",
