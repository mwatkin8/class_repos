                                     FINAL REPORT
     EXAMINATION:  MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium.
     
     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with lung cancer and right intracranial bleed
     and history of brain metastases.  Please evaluate for acute infarct.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images of the brain with gadolinium
     according to standard departmental protocol.  No prior study for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  On diffusion-weighted images there is a small area of restricted
     diffusion along the falx within the left occipitotemporal lobe.  It is also
     bright on FLAIR-weighted images and may represent a subacute infarct. Clinical
     correlation is recommended.  On gradient echo images there is a large area of
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe and left thalamus
     which following administration of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions.
     These are suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's history.
     Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra- and infratentorial
     compartments are visualized.  There is a moderate amount of peritumoral edema
     involving the right parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right
     parietal lesion along the falx high in the vertex.  The other areas of
     metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of metastatic lung cancer to the
     brain.  Question hemorrhagic mass.  Question stability of bleed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**Hospital 12568**] Hospital dated [**2644-1-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior days study, there is stable appearance of the
     right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.  At the
     superior margin of the parenchymal hemorrhage there is a rounded heterogeneous
     focus which could represent a metastatic lesion.  An additional 2mm hyperdense
     focus, possibly hemorrhage, is noted in the posteromedial margin of the left
     thalamus, with surroundng edema.  Low-attenuation foci seen in both basal
     ganglia and insular regions are consistent with chronic lacunar infarcts.
     There is no shift of midline structures.  The ventricles are stable in
     appearance.  The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right parietal lobe and left thalamic
     hemorrhages, which are concerning for hemorrhagic metastasis in this patient
     with known metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.

     This is a portable semierect chest that is dated [**2644-1-19**] compared to
     [**2644-1-17**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Question aspiration pneumonia.
     
     Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm.  The cardiac silhouette
     appears enlarged, but stable.  There is a large mass-like opacity overlying
     the left hilum, which has slightly lobulated margins.  This measures about 6
     cm in greatest diameter.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, moderate on
     the left and small on the right.  No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     As compared to the previous study, alveolar opacities adjacent to the
     perihilar mass have resolved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Marked improvement in left perihilar alveolar process with residual
     well-marginated mass-like opacity, concerning for neoplasm.  This could be
     initially confirmed with PA and lateral chest radiographs, but CT may be
     considered for more complete characterization.  Findings communicated to
     clinical service caring for the patient.

     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath and oxygen requirement.
     
     Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs of [**3264-1-29**] and [**8-14**], 2003.
     
     The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is persistent upper zone
     vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness.  Additionally, there is an
     area of increased opacity in the lingula which obscures the left heart border.
     Note is made of disruption and malalignment of the sternal wires which is
     unchanged dating back to [**3264-1-26**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Confluent lingular opacity concerning for pneumonia.  When the patient's
     condition permits, more complete evaluation with standard PA and lateral chest
     radiographs is recommended.
     2)  Mild congestive heart failure pattern.
     3)  Malalignment and disruption of multiple sternal wires which appears to be
     chronic.  This may be due to a chronic sternal dehiscence.

     HISTORY:  Sixty-eight year old man with NSTE MI, rising Troponin, s/p CABG, low
     EF, hematocrit drop.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show moderate left ventricular enlargement which does not change
     during resting perfusion images.
     
     Stress images show a moderate perfusion defect in the anterior wall which is
     unchanged in resting perfusion images.  Stress images show a moderate perfusion
     defect in the inferior wall which does not change in the resting perfusion
     images.  Stress images show a mild perfusion defect in the septum which is also
     unchanged on the resting perfusion images.
     
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 19%.  There is global hypokinesis.
     
     Compared to prior study from [**3264-1-29**], the partial reversibility on the moderate
     perfusion defect of the anterior wall in no longer seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Moderate, fixed left ventricular enlargement.  2) Moderate,
     fixed perfusion defects in the anterior and inferior walls, mild, fixed
     perfusion defect in the septal wall.  Decreased EF of 19%.

     FINDINGS: AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates the left sided central
     venous catheter has been removed. There is a dual lumen Hickman catheter
     entering from the right with its tip in the distal SVC. There is no change in
     the position of this catheter. There are no pulmonary infiltrates or pleural
     effusions. There is an ovoid structure in the right lung presumably
     projectional difference from the patient's rib or summation of structures with
     scapular tip.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. Unusual ovoid density in the right mid lung zone
     presumably due to summation of structures. Recommend attention to this area on
     followup radiographs.

     upper hemithorax.  No definite pulmonary infiltrates or effusions.  The
     osseous structures are unremarkable.  The right internal jugular central
     venous catheter tip extends to the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  There is a somewhat well-circumscribed but subtle opacity immediately
     adjacent to the external portion of the catheter overlying the right upper
     lobe.  This may be related to the catheter itself but it is difficult to
     exclude an underlying opacity in this region.  Correlation with physical exam

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Failure

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever.  Status post multiple transfusions.
     
     Compared to [**3352-7-12**].
     
     A right internal jugular vascular remains in satisfactory position.  The heart
     size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Focal opacity is
     present adjacent to the catheter at the level of the 4th anterior rib.  A
     similar opacity is seen to be present on prior films dating back to [**3352-6-3**], and is probably related to the external portion of the catheter.  The
     lungs otherwise demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation and no pleural
     effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity adjacent to external portion of right-sided
     vascular catheter, which is likely an external structure related to the
     catheter. However, given the history of fever and neutropenia, either
     additional oblique portable radiographs or a PA & lateral chest radiograph
     would be helpful to fully exclude an underlying lung abnormality in this
     region.

     CHEST, 2 VIEWS [**3352-7-20**].
     
     Compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Persistent fever.  Focal opacity on portable chest x-
     ray.
     
     Comparison is made to the recent portable chest radiograph of [**3352-7-18**],
     multiple prior radiographs dating back to [**3352-4-26**].  The heart size,
     mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable.  Again
     demonstrated is a focal, sharply marginated opacity adjacent to the external
     portion of the right internal jugular catheter at approximately the fourth
     anterior rib level.  Review of multiple prior films demostrates a similar
     opacity since the time of placement of the catheter and there is no visible
     opacity in this region within the lung on the lateral view. These findings
     favor that the observed opacity is related to the catheter. The lungs appear
     grossly clear.  No pleural effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity adjacent to catheter appears to be related to the
     catheter rather than due to a lung opacification.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fifty-four year old man with T-cell lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy,  
     presenting for restaging. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 113 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the skull base to the upper femurs. 
       
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.  
      
     FINDINGS:  No abnormal foci of FDG uptake are present.  Incidental note is made
     of uptake within the paraspinal musculature and within the neck muscles, which
     is physiologic.  
       
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the myocardium, the liver and the gastrointestinal
     tracer. 
       
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of FDG-avid disease.

     INDICATION:  T cell lymphoma, status post autologic bone marrow transplant,
     currently with neutropenic fever, evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates.
     
     FINDINGS:  PA & lateral view demonstrate the presence of a subclavian-approach
     right-sided double-lumen catheter terminating in a position overlying the SVC,
     some 4 cm below the carina and just above the expected entrance into the right
     atrium.  There is no pneumothorax or any other catheter-related complication.
     The heart size is within normal limits.  Thoracic aorta and mediastinal
     structures are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No signs of
     acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Ordinary thoracic
     khyposis on lateral view with normal-appearing vertebral bodies and free
     posterior pleural sinuses.

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No acute intracranial
     hemorrhage is identified.  There is no mass effect or shift of normally
     midline structures.  The lateral ventricles are symmetric and nondilated.  The
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is preserved.  The density values of the brain
     parenchyma are within normal limits.  Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of
     fracture.  The mastoid air cells and visualized portions of the paranasal
     sinuses are normally pneumatized.  There are multiple rounded lucencies within
     the cortex of the calvarium near the vertex.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  No evidence of infarct.
     CT has limited sensitivity in the detection of early infarct.  If there is
     clinical suspicion, an MR of the brain with diffusion- weighted imaging is
     recommended.
     These findings were discussed with the intern caring for the patient at the
     time of image interpretation.
     
     2.  Multiple punctate lucencies within the cortex of the calvarium, of
     uncertain significance.

     INDICATION:  55-year-old man with new onset right-sided facial weakness,
     evaluate for infarct, ischemia, or mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1- and T2-weighted images were performed through the brain.
     Diffusion-weighted images were also performed.  3D time-of-flight imaging was
     performed through the circle of [**Location (un) **] and its major tributaries with
     multiplanar reformatted images for a brain MRA.
     
     BRAIN MR:  There are no areas of slowed diffusion to suggest an acute stroke.
     There are no areas of abnormal enhancement on the post-contrast weighted
     images.  There is no evidence of blood products on the gradient echo weighted
     images.  There is nonspecific hyperintensity in the periventricular white
     matter seen best on the FLAIR-weighted sequence.  This is also apparent on the
     T2-weighted images.
     
     There is no shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles are not
     dilated.
     
     BRAIN MRA:  The vertebral arteries, anterior/inferior cerebellar arteries,
     superior cerebellar arteries, posterior cerebellar arteries, posterior
     communicating arteries, middle cerebral arteries, anterior cerebral arteries,
     and internal carotid arteries are seen and appear normal.  There is a small,

     a tortuosity and not an aneurysm. If clinically warranted, an MR angiogram
     may be performed in 4-6 months to assess interval  change.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  55-year-old man with new onset right-sided facial weakness,
     evaluate for infarct, ischemia, or mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1- and T2-weighted images were performed through the brain.
     Diffusion-weighted images were also performed.  3D time-of-flight imaging was
     performed through the circle of [**Location (un) **] and its major tributaries with
     multiplanar reformatted images for a brain MRA.
     
     BRAIN MR:  There are no areas of slowed diffusion to suggest an acute stroke.
     There are no areas of abnormal enhancement on the post-contrast weighted
     images.  There is no evidence of blood products on the gradient echo weighted
     images.  There is nonspecific hyperintensity in the periventricular white
     matter seen best on the FLAIR-weighted sequence.  This is also apparent on the
     T2-weighted images.
     
     There is no shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles are not
     dilated.
     
     BRAIN MRA:  The vertebral arteries, anterior/inferior cerebellar arteries,
     superior cerebellar arteries, posterior cerebellar arteries, posterior
     communicating arteries, middle cerebral arteries, anterior cerebral arteries,
     and internal carotid arteries are seen and appear normal.  There is a small,
     1.0 mm prominence off the anterior communicating artery that could represent
     a tiny aneurysm vs. tortuosity of the vessel.  No significant areas of
     stenoses are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  No evidence of acute stroke.
     2.  Nonspecific T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter of the
     parietal lobes.
     3.  A 1.0 mm prominence of the anterior communicating artery which could
     represent a tortuosity of a vessel, however, a tiny aneurysm in this site
     cannot be excluded.  No other areas suspicious for aneurysmal dilatation are
     identified.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  This is a 55 year old man with history of sprue and a T-cell
     lymphoma of the small bowel.  Assess for leptomeningeal enhancement.  Recent
     bone marrow biopsy revealed findings suspicious for T-cell lymphoma throughout
     the marrow.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, and axial T1, T2, T1 post contrast and
     sagittal T1 weighted images post gadolinium contrast administration were
     obtained.  There are no prior spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The cervicomedullary junction is within normal limits.  There is no
     abnormal signal in or enhancement of the cervical spinal cord.  There is no
     evidence of meningeal enhancement or cervical spinal cord compression.  The
     marrow signal of the cervical vertebra is diffusely increased on the STIR
     images.  There is also mild diffuse enhancement of the marrow cavities of the
     cervical vertebra.  Our differential for these findings is serous atrophy of
     the marrow cavities versus diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  The signal
     characteristics and enhancement characteristics are very uniform throughout
     the cervical marrow cavities.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, axial T2, and sagittal and axial T1
     weighted images post gadolinium contrast administration were obtained of the
     thoracic spine.  There are no prior spine MRI's for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no abnormal signal in the thoracic spinal cord.  There is
     no abnormal enhancement in or compression of the thoracic spinal cord.  Again,
     the marrow signal in the thoracic vertebra is diffusely increased on the STIR
     images.  This abnormality may be due to serous atrophy versus diffuse
     infiltration by lymphoma.  There is also diffuse subtle enhancement throughout
     the marrow cavities in the thoracic spine as well.  There is no evidence of a
     compression deformity in the thoracic spine.  The paraspinal soft tissues are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased signal in the marrow cavities of the thoracic
     vertebra on the STIR images with associated mild diffuse enhancement on the
     post contrast images.  Our differential diagnosis for this finding is serous
     atrophy versus diffuse infiltration via lymphoma.

     FINDINGS:  The tip of the conus medullaris terminates in the normal position
     at the inferior endplate of L1.  There is no evidence of compression of the
     conus medullaris or cauda equina.  There is no abnormal enhancement of the
     cauda equina on the post contrast images.  Again, there is diffuse increased
     signal in the lumbar vertebra on the STIR images.  In the posterior aspect of
     L4 vertebral body, there is an area of decreased signal which may represent
     some residual normal fatty marrow.  The other marrow cavities decrease
     increased signal on the STIR images and mild diffuse enhancement on the post
     contrast images.  Again, we are suspicious of either serous atrophy versus
     diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  There is a small right paracentral disc
     protrusion of a degenerated L5-S1 intervertebral disc.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.

     cauda equina on the post contrast images.  Again, there is diffuse increased
     signal in the lumbar vertebra on the STIR images.  In the posterior aspect of
     L4 vertebral body, there is an area of decreased signal which may represent
     some residual normal fatty marrow.  The other marrow cavities decrease
     increased signal on the STIR images and mild diffuse enhancement on the post
     contrast images.  Again, we are suspicious of either serous atrophy versus
     diffuse infiltration by lymphoma.  There is a small right paracentral disc
     protrusion of a degenerated L5-S1 intervertebral disc.
     
     The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased signal in the marrow cavities on the STIR
     images with associated mild diffuse enhancement on the post contrast images.
     Our differential for these findings include serous atrophy versus diffuse
     infiltration by lymphoma.
     
     No evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement or cord compression.
     
     Small right paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with a history of celiac sprue and T-
     cell lymphoma.  Assess for recurrence.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT images were obtained from the lung bases through the symphysis
     pubis following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3352-7-16**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Visualized lung bases demonstrate a
     stable-appearing tiny noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the lingula.  There
     are no pleural effusions.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
     glands, and right kidney are grossly normal.  Two hypodense exophytic lesions
     arising from the left kidney are unchanged.  The stomach and visualized loops
     of small and large bowel are unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.  Note is made of
     atherosclerotic changes of the abdominal aorta, but its major intraabdominal
     branches are patent.  There is no free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, distal ureters,
     seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and pelvic loops of bowel appear grossly
     normal.  A small amount of free pelvic fluid is present.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Stable appearance of tiny noncalcified lingular nodule.
     
     2)  Stable appearance of two hypodense exophytic lesions arising from the left
     kidney.  These are incompletely characterized in this study but most likely
     represent cysts.

     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the Chest performed after the intravenous administration of
     100 mL of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to patient debility.
     Comparison is made to a PET CT of [**3352-9-21**] and a CT of the torso from
     [**3352-4-26**].
     
     CT of the chest with contrast:  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or
     mediastinal nodes are seen.  The heart, pericardium, great vessels are within
     normal limits.
     
     There is mild diffuse centrilobular emphysema.  Calcified granulomas are seen
     within the left lower lobe (series 3 image 35) as well as within the lingula
     (series 3 image 38) and within the left apex (series 3, image 7).  Tiny 2-3 mm
     noncalcified pulmonary nodules are seen within the right upper lobe (series 3

     nodules were present on the prior CT from [**3352-4-26**] and are unchanged.  No
     new pulmonary nodules or areas of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation are
     identified.  Pleural effusion is seen.  Airways are patent to the level of the
     subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.

     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Mild diffuse emphysematous changes are
     again demonstrated, stable.  Multiple bilateral 1-3 mm pulmonary nodules are
     unchanged in size and distribution compared to the study of [**3352-11-30**] and CT
     dated [**3352-4-26**].  There are no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or
     mediastinal lymph nodes.  A central line is demonstrated in the SVC.  The
     heart and pericardium are within normal limits.  There are no areas of
     parenchymal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
     stomach, duodenum, and intraabdominal loops of small and large bowel are
     within normal limits.  There are no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or
     mesenteric lymph nodes.  There is no free air or free fluid.  Two exophytic
     left renal cysts are unchanged.  The adrenal glands have a normal appearance.
     Extensive calcification and circumferential atherosclerotic change is again
     noted in the abdominal aorta.
     
     CT of the pelvis with IV contrast:  The bladder, prostate gland, rectum, and
     sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.

     HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma.  Needs PICC line
     reposition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 687**] [**Name (STitle) 688**] and Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1655**] [**Name (STitle) 343**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 343**], the attending radiologist supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     The patient was placed on the angiography table.  The left arm was prepared in
     a sterile fashion.  The patient presented with an indwelling PICC line placed
     at bedside with malpositioned tip shown on previous chest x-ray.  Fluoroscopy
     was used and showed the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Under
     fluoroscopic guidance, the line was advanced further into the superior vena
     cava.  The line was flushed and secured to the skin with a Stat-Lock.  A chest
     x-ray was obtained documenting adequate tip position in the superior vena
     cava.  The line is ready for use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful reposition of double-lumen left-sided PICC line.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate for new lymph nodes, pulmonary disease, abdominal
     process causing fever, and history of enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso, [**3352-12-7**]; CT chest, [**3352-11-30**]; and CT
     abdomen, [**3352-11-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
     pubic symphysis.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 mL of Optiray was administered.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  Multiple 2 mm, noncalcified nodules are present throughout the
     lungs.  These are stable compared with the prior studies.  No new pulmonary
     nodules are detected.  There are no pleural effusions.  The airways are
     patent.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, small and large bowel are unremarkable.  A rounded
     hypodense lesion extends from the upper pole of the left kidney.  There is a
     smaller hypodense lesion extending from the lower pole of the left kidney.
     These likely represent simple renal cysts.  The remainder of the kidneys
     appear unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.
     There is no hydronephrosis. There is no abdominal adenopathy.  Atherosclerotic
     plaque is noted along the abdominal aorta.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is complete occlusion of
     the proximal portions of the iliac vessels bilaterally.  Both vessels
     demonstrate reconstitution proximal to the level of the common femoral
     arteries.  The occluded segment of the right iliac artery is less than 1cm.
     
     There is no bowel wall thickening. The prostate, urinary bladder, and distal
     ureters are unremarkable.
     
     No osseous abnormalities are detected.

     INDICATION:  This is a patient with T cell lymphoma.  Now presenting with
     fever of unknown origin and elevated LDH.  Evaluate for any form of
     recurrence.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to [**3352-12-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to patient's request.
     
     CT of the chest with IV contrast:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are again noted multiple 2-mm noncalcified nodules
     throughout the lungs.  These nodules are stable when compared to the prior
     studies.  There are no new pulmonary nodules seen.  There are no pleural
     effusions.  The airways are patent.
     
     CT of the abdomen with oral and IV contrast:  There is a new soft tissue mass
     located in the periportal region, anteriorly to the pancreas (series 2, image
     62) that measures 2.0 x 1.8 cm.  This was not seen in the prior studies and
     most likely represents a peripancreatic lymph node.  This is concerning for
     lymphoma recurrence.  A PET/CT scan could be performed for further evaluation.
     
     Theliver is unremarkable.  There are no focal masses.  The portal vein,
     hepatic veins and hepatic artery are patent.  The spleen measures 14 cm and is
     borderline in size.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is again
     noted exophytic simple cysts in the left kidney that are unchanged when
     compared to prior studies.  The small and large bowel are unchanged.
     
     CT of the pelvis with oral and IV contrast:  There is again noted occlusion of
     the proximal portions of the iliac vessels bilaterally.  Both vessels
     demonstrate reconstitution of the common femoral arteries.  This finding is
     unchanged when compared to the prior study.  The urinary bladder, rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  There are

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  This is a patient with T cell lymphoma.  Now presenting with
     fever of unknown origin and elevated LDH.  Evaluate for any form of
     recurrence.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to [**3352-12-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to patient's request.
     
     CT of the chest with IV contrast:  There is no significant axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are again noted multiple 2-mm noncalcified nodules
     throughout the lungs.  These nodules are stable when compared to the prior
     studies.  There are no new pulmonary nodules seen.  There are no pleural
     effusions.  The airways are patent.
     
     CT of the abdomen with oral and IV contrast:  There is a new soft tissue mass
     located in the periportal region, anteriorly to the pancreas (series 2, image
     62) that measures 2.0 x 1.8 cm.  This was not seen in the prior studies and
     most likely represents a peripancreatic lymph node.  This is concerning for
     lymphoma recurrence.  A PET/CT scan could be performed for further evaluation.
     
     Theliver is unremarkable.  There are no focal masses.  The portal vein,
     hepatic veins and hepatic artery are patent.  The spleen measures 14 cm and is
     borderline in size.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is again
     noted exophytic simple cysts in the left kidney that are unchanged when
     compared to prior studies.  The small and large bowel are unchanged.
     
     CT of the pelvis with oral and IV contrast:  There is again noted occlusion of
     the proximal portions of the iliac vessels bilaterally.  Both vessels
     demonstrate reconstitution of the common femoral arteries.  This finding is
     unchanged when compared to the prior study.  The urinary bladder, rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  There are
     multiple hemangiomas throughout the vertebral bodies.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  T-cell lymphoma.  Neutropenia.  Tachycardia, tachypnea,
     respiratory alkalosis.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest were acquired before and after
     administration of 100 mL of Optiray IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were made.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT scan from [**3353-1-21**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Pulmonary vasculature is well
     opacified and demonstrates no intraluminal filling defects suggestive of
     pulmonary emboli.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  No enlarged
     left hilar nodes are seen.  Multiple prominent right hilar nodes are present,
     but none of which meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement in size.  The
     appearance is unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     Evaluation of lung windows shows a new patchy area of consolidation within the
     lingula. There is a suggestion of faint bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity
     compared to the prior study.  Small nodules in the right lower lobe and left
     apex are unchanged.
     
     The osseous structures are unchanged.  Limited assessment of upper abdominal
     structures is unchanged since the prior torso CT scan.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images show no pulmonary
     emboli.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No pulmonary embolus.
     2)  New patchy area of consolidation within the anterior lingula.  Findings
     are suspicious for an infectious process given the patient's neutropenic
     status.
     3)  Faint diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs, a completely
     nonspecific finding, but which could also be due to an infectious process.

     FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)                                      Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 1664**]
     Reason: LYMPHOMA, RESTAGING.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lymphoma, restaging.  H/o celiac sprue and enteropathy associated 
     lymphoma with new tissue mass seen in porta hepatis on recent CT torso. 
     
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18  
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 131 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the base of the skull to the proximal femurs.
      
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake. 
     
     COMPARISON:  PET CT from [**3352-9-21**], CT torso from [**3353-1-11**], chest CT from [**3353-1-15**].
     
     INTERPRETATION:  An FDG-avid right adrenal mass is identified measuring
     approximately 2.3 x 1.1 cm, with a maximal SUV value of 13.9.  In retrospect,
     this right adrenal lesion was seen on the prior CT scans dating back to [**3352-12-18**].
      Additionally, there is mildly increased FDG activity demonstrated within the
     medial limb of the left adrenal gland with a small nodule seen measuring
     approximately 1.7 x 1.0 cm.  The maximal SUV value for this left adrenal lesion
     is 3.0.
     
     Additionally, there has been interval development of new foci of abnormally
     increased FDG activity within the osseous structures including the right 1st
     rib, anterolateral portion of the right 2nd rib, posterior right 8th rib,
     posterior aspect of the right 10th rib, the left scapula, medial aspect of the
     left clavicle, and the T7 and L4 vertebral bodies.
      
     Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the myocardium, liver and gastrointestinal
     tract.
      
     CT imaging findings include an ill-defined area of ground-glass opacity and
     nodule within the lingula, not significantly changed since the prior chest CT. 
     There is no associated FDG avidity with this lesion.  Multiple tiny
     subcentimeter pulmonary nodules are seen within both lungs, unchanged since the
     prior examinations, and too small to characterize on the PET scan.  Previously
     identified porta hepatis soft tissue lesion on the CT torso examination is not
     identified on the current noncontrast study.  No abnormal FDG activity is
     demonstrated within the region of the porta hepatis.  Stable left anterior iliac
     lesion is seen with a sclerotic rim, which does not demonstrate any abnormal
     FDG activity. 
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) New, FDG-avid, bilateral adrenal lesions, right greater than
     left, as well as multiple abnormal foci of increased FDG activity within the
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  55-year-old man with T cell lymphoma status post bone marrow
     transplant, now with neutropenic fevers.
     
     SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST dated [**3353-1-26**], is compared with single AP
     view of the chest dated [**3353-1-22**].  There is a new, subtle right lower
     lobe density, which appears to spread along the bronchovascular bundle with an
     adjacent peripheral opacity in the costophrenic angle.  This finding is
     worrisome for infection, especially aspergillus, in this neutropenic patient.
     A chest CT is recommended to further characterize the nature of this opacity.
     No other focal opacities are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The left
     costophrenic angle is clear.  Again seen is the right PICC line terminating in
     the mid SVC.  The heart and mediasdtinal contours are normal and unchanged.
     The bones are osteopenic.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right lower lobe opacity with more focal peripheral opacity
     in the right costophrenic angle, suspicious for infection, especially
     aspergillus, in this neutropenic patient. CT may be helpful for confirmation
     and further characterization. These findings were discussed at the conclusion
     of the examination with the physician covering for [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1669**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1670**] [**Doctor First Name 1671**]
     Dharmal.
     
     Possible small right pleural effusion.

     INDICATION:  Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and neutropenia,
     tachycardic and tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis, please evaluate new
     right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray and rule out empyema.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated [**3353-1-15**], and PET CT dated
     [**3353-1-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest following the
     administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Additional thin section
     reformatted images are provided.
     
     CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The aorta is normal in caliber,
     with scattered mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease.
     There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Multiple small mediastinal,
     hilar, and axillary lymph nodes are seen, not individually meeting criteria
     for pathologic enlargement.  The largest of these, located in the right hilum,
     measures 8 mm in short axis diameter.  The airways are patent to the level of
     the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are multifocal areas of patchy
     opacity throughout the lungs, most prominently located within the right middle
     lobe and within the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.  In addition,
     there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions and minimal adjacent atelectasis
     within the lower lobes.  There is a suggestion of peripheral septal thickening
     at the apices.  Two tiny, calcified nodular opacities are seen at the left
     apex, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver,
     spleen, adrenal glands, and upper poles of the kidneys, demonstrate fullness
     of the right adrenal gland without definite focal mass identified, a finding
     that is consistent with the PET CT finding of abnormal uptake within the
     adrenal glands.  No mass or fullness is identified within the left adrenal
     gland.  There is a simple cyst arising from the upper pole of the left kidney
     containing internal fluid density.  The visualized portions of the liver and
     spleen appear unremarkable.  Heterogeneity within the spleen is likely related
     to the phase of contrast administration.
     
     The appearance of the osseous structures is unchanged, with increased
                                                                 (Over)

     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest following the
     administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Additional thin section
     reformatted images are provided.
     
     CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The aorta is normal in caliber,
     with scattered mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease.
     There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Multiple small mediastinal,
     hilar, and axillary lymph nodes are seen, not individually meeting criteria
     for pathologic enlargement.  The largest of these, located in the right hilum,
     measures 8 mm in short axis diameter.  The airways are patent to the level of
     the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are multifocal areas of patchy
     opacity throughout the lungs, most prominently located within the right middle
     lobe and within the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.  In addition,
     there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions and minimal adjacent atelectasis
     within the lower lobes.  There is a suggestion of peripheral septal thickening
     at the apices.  Two tiny, calcified nodular opacities are seen at the left
     apex, consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver,
     spleen, adrenal glands, and upper poles of the kidneys, demonstrate fullness
     of the right adrenal gland without definite focal mass identified, a finding
     that is consistent with the PET CT finding of abnormal uptake within the
     adrenal glands.  No mass or fullness is identified within the left adrenal
     gland.  There is a simple cyst arising from the upper pole of the left kidney
     containing internal fluid density.  The visualized portions of the liver and
     spleen appear unremarkable.  Heterogeneity within the spleen is likely related
     to the phase of contrast administration.
     
     The appearance of the osseous structures is unchanged, with increased
                                                                 (Over)

     pain and fever.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3353-1-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast and 100 cc of Optiray.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The airways are patent to the level of
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are no pericardial effusions.  There is
     a tiny right-sided pleural effusion.  The image quality is degraded by
     patient's poor breathhold.  No significantly-enlarged axillary, mediastinal,
     or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  Again seen are small nodules, less optimally
     visualized on today's study secondary to poor breathhold.  There is a nodular
     density measuring 5 mm seen on series 2, image 28 in the right middle lobe,
     which is new and nonspecific.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an extensive amount of free air
     seen in the abdomen surrounding the liver and extending inferiorly to the
     level of the umbilicus.  There is a moderate amount of free fluid surrounding
     the liver, spleen, both paracolic gutters and extending and into the pelvis
     surrounding the bladder.  The free fluid is of low attenuation.  Oral contrast
     is seen through loops of small bowel, and there is no active extravasation of
     oral contrast identified.  The loops of small bowel, specifically, the ileal
     loops, are thickened and abnormal in appearance, and in this patient, graft
     versus host disease is also a consideration.
     
     No significantly-enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.  The previously
     seen periportal lymph node is again identified on series 2B, image 75, not
     significantly changed.
     
     The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There is no

     the liver, spleen, both paracolic gutters and extending and into the pelvis
     surrounding the bladder.  The free fluid is of low attenuation.  Oral contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Severe abdominal pain, hypotension.  Please assess the aorta with a
     non-contrast scan.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the abdomen and pelvis, without the administration of IV or oral contrast, as
     per the request of the emergency room attending physician caring for the
     patient.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are incompletely imaged coronary
     artery calcifications.  There is dependent atelectasis within the visualized
     portions of the lung bases.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
     right kidney are unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended.  There is an
     approximately 5 cm exophytic simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney.
     The left kidney is otherwise unremarkable.  There are diffuse vascular
     calcifications throughout the abdomen. There is diffuse calcification of the
     intra-abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries.  There is no evidence,
     however, of aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta or gross dissection (this is a
     limited assessment for dissection, given the non-contrast nature of this
     examination).  There is no free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy within the
     abdomen.  The unopacified loops of large/small bowel are unremarkable. There
     is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again noted are diffuse vascular
     calcifications.  A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed urinary bladder.
     There are multiple sigmoid diverticula without evidence of associated
     inflammatory changes.  The rectum and visualized loops of bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland.
     There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate diffuse degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
     There is a solitary bone island of the right ischium.  The osseous structures
     are otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Limited non-contrast examination demonstrates diffuse vascular
     calcifications, but no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid.
     
                                                                 (Over)
