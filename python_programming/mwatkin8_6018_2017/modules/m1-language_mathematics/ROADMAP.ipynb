    "This module has a quiz and a homework but no in-class component. What I hope to accomplish in this module is to get you thinking a little bit about how we use language and how every domain creates sub-languages. Programming and mathematics are both examples of sub-languages. When we start learning Python we will use words that are familiar with like `for` and `while` and `class` but within the sub-language of Python these words (symbols) will have different (but probably related) meaning to what they have in everyday use.\n",
