    "You have been given a file that consists of phenotypes that have been assigned to individual cardiology patients. The data was supposed to have been entered as a table with two columns per patient. The first column was to be a single, primary phenotype for a patient. The second column was to be a comma separated list of secondary phenotypes for that patient. Unfortunately, data entry did not follow this prescription and was inconsistent. Sometimes multiple phenotypes are provided in column one, sometimes a different delimiter than a comma is used.\n",

    "Your task is to provide an alphabetically sorted list of unique phenotypes encountered in the data. Missing values are denoted by an empty string and should **not** be treated as a phenotype.\n",
