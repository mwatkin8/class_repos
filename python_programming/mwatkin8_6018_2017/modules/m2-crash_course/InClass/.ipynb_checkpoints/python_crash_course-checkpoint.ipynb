    "The Greek philosopher Pythagoras reportedly said, \"All is number!\". Deep down in the computer, Pythagoras is correct but in this course we are primarily going to think of data as consisting of **strings** and **numbers**. Adopting a physical metaphor, we can say that numbers and strings are our atoms of data. We can then combine numbers and strings to create molecules of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most important components of the programs we will be writing are **data objects** and **function objects.** Using a biology analogy, data objects are like the blood circulating through our bodies and function objects are like our organs that take blood in and return modified blood and some biological behavior.\n",

    "Python comes with a lot, but it doesn't come with everything so people create third-party packages such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). These do not come with Python and so have to be **installed** separately. The Python package index (pypi) is a central listing of third-party packages. In a somewhat circular fashion, Python provides a third-party package [(pip)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to help install third-party packages.\n",

Anaconda also has its own [package index](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs) and its own function [``conda``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html) for installing packages."

Technically, a string is an example of a Python data structure: a collection of basic data (atoms), in this case, a character. But since Python does not have a single character data type, strings end up being a bit of a hybrid. Other data structures that come with Python include:\n",
