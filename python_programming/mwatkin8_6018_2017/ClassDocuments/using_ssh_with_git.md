# Using ssh with Gitlab

In these notes and videos, we go over how to change our gitlab repositories to use ssh rather than https to communicate between jupyterhub and gitlab.chpc.utah.edu.

## Creating ssh keys

Gitlab provides notes about creating ssh keys [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair)

I've made a video of the process and loaded it to YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/vWJw89GAjro). Please follow along with the steps I take in the Video.

## Modifying our git repository to use ssh

I follow along the steps described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/#switching-remote-urls-from-https-to-ssh) for modifying our existing repositories. I've made a video showing these steps and uploaded it to YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/CUZRDVd4cpo).
