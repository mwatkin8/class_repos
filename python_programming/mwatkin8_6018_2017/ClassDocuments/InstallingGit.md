# Installing Git

If you are working on a Mac or Linux machine, Git should already be installed. If you do not have Git on your Mac, I recommend installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or and using `brew install git`.

If you are on a Windows machine, GitHub has a nice [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) package that includes a bash shell.

There are also git GUIs for both Mac and PCs. GitHub has a [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for both Macs and PCs. Atlassian has created [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for both Macs and PCs
